It acts as a translator between human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) and their corresponding IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.0.1). DNS servers are responsible for converting domain names into IP addresses and vice versa, allowing users to access websites and services using memorable domain names.</p>`,
