        question: `What is Shared Hosting and how does it work?`,

    },
    {   question: `Can i host multiple websites on a shared hosting plan?`,
        answer: `Yes, many shared hosting plans allow you to host multiple websites on a single account. These plans often provide support for multiple domains and subdomains, making it possible to manage several websites from one hosting plan. Users typically don't need to upgrade for this feature, but it's essential to check the specific details of the shared hosting plan with your hosting provider to confirm the number of domains and websites allowed.`,

    {   question: `Can i upgrade my shared hosting plan as my website grows?`,
